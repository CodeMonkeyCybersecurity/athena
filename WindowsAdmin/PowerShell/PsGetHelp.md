PowerShell provides native cmdlets and functions that you can use to search for other cmdlets, modules, or related information. Here are some common ways to search for cmdlets and modules using PowerShell:

Get-Help:

Use the Get-Help cmdlet to retrieve information about cmdlets, functions, workflows, aliases, providers, and scripts. For example:
powershell
Copy code
Get-Help Get-Process
Get-Command:

The Get-Command cmdlet allows you to find cmdlets, functions, workflows, aliases, and scripts. You can filter based on different properties like verb, noun, module, etc.
powershell
Copy code
Get-Command -Name "*-Process" -CommandType Cmdlet
Get-Module:

Use Get-Module to list the modules that are currently imported or available on your system.
powershell
Copy code
Get-Module -ListAvailable
Get-Command with Module Parameter:

You can use Get-Command with the -Module parameter to find commands from a specific module.
powershell
Copy code
Get-Command -Module YourModuleName
Find-Module:

If you're looking for PowerShell modules available on the PowerShell Gallery, you can use Find-Module to search and install modules directly from the gallery.
powershell
Copy code
Find-Module -Name ModuleName
Get-Alias:

To find aliases, you can use Get-Alias.
powershell
Copy code
Get-Alias -Name aliasName
These cmdlets provide a range of options to search for and explore PowerShell cmdlets, functions, modules, and related information. Adjust the examples based on your specific needs, and use the -Help parameter for each cmdlet to get more information on their usage and available parameters.
