Yes, there are several free alternatives to Docker Hub for hosting your container images. Here are some popular options:

1. GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)

GitHub’s container registry allows you to store Docker images alongside your code repositories.
	•	Advantages:
	•	Free for public repositories (and private repositories for personal accounts with limits).
	•	Easy to integrate with GitHub Actions for CI/CD.
	•	Supports granular permissions.
	•	Usage:
	•	Authenticate:

echo $GH_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u <your-username> --password-stdin


	•	Tag and push your image:

docker tag custom-nginx:latest ghcr.io/<your-username>/custom-nginx:latest
docker push ghcr.io/<your-username>/custom-nginx:latest
